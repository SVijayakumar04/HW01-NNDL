# Cross Validation for Polynomial Linear Fitting

This assignment illustrates how to perform k-fold crossvalication for a simple linear fitting of a polynomial model. Go over the content of the `RunScript` notebook for details. You can modify this notebook if you want to further analyze the variables created. You should only modify the `kfold_split.py` and `kfold_crossval.py` files in the sections marked between
```
### <--- START OF YOUR CODE
```
and
```
### END OF YOUR CODE --->
```

You can verify your answers by performing a unit test for each script using `pytest` with the corresponding files `test_*.py`. Note that you should pass the test in `test_kfold_split` first and then `test_kfold_crossval`.
